Tutorial to using GitHub, Git and Webstorm.
The first step is to create an account with GitHub, and then to begin working with it, you make a repo. The repo will hold the source code you upload to it from your machine, made on an IDE. For this, we will use Webstorm as our IDE. Fortunately we can make our repo from Webstorm, so we'd do that here. Once downloaded, you need to login to your GitHub account from here and From here, you can share your repo along with the code available on it for others to copy or work alongside with you.
