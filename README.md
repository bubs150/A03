Tutorial to using GitHub, Git and Webstorm.
The first step is to create an account with GitHub, and then to begin working with it, you make a repo. The repo will hold the source code you upload to it from your machine, made on an IDE. Before we can even begin to code, we need to download Git, distinctly different in purpose from GitHub. Where GitHub is the cloud based storage of repos holding source codes and their iterations to be shared or changed by others withg permission, Git is the actual software needed to push the code up to GitHub through commits and pushes. Though it is possible without and IDE to upload files through Git or even make new files,  it is simply easier to use an IDE. So for this, we will use Webstorm as our IDE. Once you've downloaded Webstorm and Git, you need to login to your GitHub account from here so as to be able to commit and push and of your changes to the repo on GitHub. The commit step is how you can later regard the changes you've made to source code during prior iterations. You leave a message for your future self to know that, for example, the 3rd push of new code was done to "Add a home page" and that would be your commit message. The "push" step is to actually create the new iteration of the source code, essentially updating it without deleting the old versions in case you'd like to revisit them. From here, you can share your repo along with the code available on it for others to copy or work alongside with you.
